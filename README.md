# Titanic-Project-Kaggle-Competition
Kaggle Titanic competition that is being hosted on kaggle.com in which I particpated. This is my solution to the challenge.

In this project my aim is to build a machine learning model that will best predict the survival of the passengers aboard the famous Titanic Ship that sank.
It is a knowledge based open machine learning competition on kaggle.com
